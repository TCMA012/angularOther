Stackblitz does not support reading json files from a folder defined in the angular.json file. Rather, you need to copy the products folder from the api folder to the assets folder. Then modify the productUrl to look in the assets folder: private productUrl = 'assets/products/products.json';

To install packages in Stackblitz, such as bootstrap and font-awesome, you need to use the DEPENDENCIES branch in the Project hierarchy to the left of the code in Stackblitz:

    Open the DEPENDENCIES node. (You should see the list of existing dependencies such as @angular/common
    Below the list of dependencies is an input box with the text "enter package name"
    Enter bootstrap there and press enter.
    If it asks you to install missing dependencies, click "INSTALL MISSING DEPENDENCIES"
    Repeat step 3 with font-awesome

Stackbliz has the Angular CLI commands built in. Instead of installing the Angular CLI to your system, right-click on a folder in Stackblitz and you'll see an "Angular Generator" option. Under that menu you'll find the Angular CLI commands.

Stackblitz does not seem to recognize the Font Awesome icons. So you will instead see portions of squares.
