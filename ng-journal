If you are not familiar with Nx and the Enterprise Monorepo Pattern, you can watch this video explaining it using this repo: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtmtNP6qNis&ab_channel=StefanHaas

Combining nx generators is super simple btw because a generator is just a function which is composable of other generators

lack of internationalization.
usually I would use transloco for that

But is transloco enterprise per say? I tried weblate and that worked well for devs but nondevs had trouble using it. But it allowed multi repo sharing and access etc...

sure, why not. In my opinion it is the 
best alternative to ngx translate which is not being maintained anymore. Therefore it would be my goto, plus nice little features like translation scopes



For the most part it’s fine but I wouldn’t call it enterprise. The main reason is you have no error management. It’s pretty but fragile.

Also what you are referring as the facade pattern is the repository pattern.
