angular HttpClient get method not calling the server
angular HttpClient.get() no response 

Angular httpClient by design returns a cold observable, which means that until you subscribe for it, no data will pass trough the stream and each new subscription will return brand new data from the endpoint, so that is the reason that there are no calls to the desired endpoint


private url = 'http://localhost:7002/myproj/api/domain';

callServer (): Observable<string> {
    console.log("in callServer()");
    return this.http.get<string>(this.url);
}



must subscribe for the http response 
callServer().subscribe(x=> console.log(x)).

=

getHeroes (): Observable<Hero[]> {
  return this.http.get<Hero[]>(this.heroesUrl)
}
